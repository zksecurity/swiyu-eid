# Getting started with the SWIYU Generic Issuer (For integration use)

<div class="notice--danger">
  <h4 class="no_toc">Public Beta</h4>
  {{ notice-text | markdownify }}
</div>

This software, together with the other generic components provided, forms a collection of APIs allowing the issuance and
verification of verifiable credentials, as visualized in the image below.
Additional documentation can be found in this GitHub
repository.[GitHub repository](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please be advised that the current system and its operations are provided on a best-effort basis and will continue to
> evolve over time. The security of the system and its overall maturity remain under development.

# Deployment instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure that you did the following steps before starting the deployment:
>
> - Registered yourself on the swiyu Trust Infrastructure portal
> - Registered yourself on the API self-service portal
> - Generated signing keys e.g. using the `didtoolbox.jar`
> - Generated a DID which is registered on the identifier registry
>
> The required steps are explained more thoroughly in
>
the [Base- and Trust Registry Cookbook](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/cookbooks/onboarding-base-and-trust-registry/)

## Set the environment variables

A sample compose file for an entire setup of both components and a database can be found in [
`sample.compose.yml`](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer/blob/main/sample.compose.yml) file. You will need
to configure a list of environment variables in the `.env` file.

Please note that the default configuration of the issuer service is geared towards easily gaining experience with the

verification process, not intended for production use. For additional information on how to securely deploy the
swiyu-issuer check out
the [Deployment considerations](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer/blob/main/README.md#deployment-considerations)
in the readme.

The provided images can be used with ARM based processors, but they are not optimized.

The latest image is available here:

- [swiyu-issuer](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer/releases)

Once the service is deployed you can create your first verifiable credential (vc).

## Creating a verifiable credential

> [!TIP]
> For a detailed understanding of the issuance process please consult the [Issuance Process](issuance.md) or
> the [documentation](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer/blob/main/docs/Architecture_generic_issuer.pdf).

Below you find an example for with the interactions needed with the issuer to issue a verifiable credential. The
following request can be performed by using the [swagger endpoint](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html) for the
sample environment.

**Request**

> [!WARNING]
> The example below is only a bare minimum working example.

### 1. Create status list entry

First, you need to create a status list

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/management/api/status-list' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "type": "string",
  "maxLength": 100000,
  "config": {
    "bits": 2
  }
}'
```

With the response:

```json
{
    "id": "36f98a79-4be7-4978-bc46-071d8e40343a",
    "statusRegistryUrl": "your new $STATUS_REGISTRY_URL",
    "type": "TOKEN_STATUS_LIST",
    "maxListEntries": 100000,
    "remainingListEntries": 100000,
    "version": "1.0",
    "config": {
        "bits": 2
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommended to store the value of `"statusRegistryUrl"` response field, as it is needed in later steps and will
> be referenced as `$STATUS_REGISTRY_URL`.

More details about the status list creation can be found [here](issuance.md#create-status-list-entry).

### 2. Create an initial vc offer

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/management/api/credentials' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "metadata_credential_supported_id": [
    "university_example_sd_jwt"
  ],
  "credential_subject_data": {
    "type": "Bachelor of Science",
    "name":"Data Science",
    "average_grade":"5.33"
  },
  "offer_validity_seconds": 86400,
  "credential_valid_until": "2030-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credential_valid_from": "2025-01-01T18:23:24Z",
  "status_lists": [
    "$STATUS_REGISTRY_URL"
  ]
}'
```

With the response:

The request above should produce the following response (the placeholders `${CREDENTIAL_ID}` and
`${SWIYU_OFFER_DEEPLINK}` denote concrete values):

```json
{
    "management_id": "${CREDENTIAL_ID}",
    "offer_deeplink": "${SWIYU_OFFER_DEEPLINK}"
}
```

## Update status

You can set the following status: `CANCELLED`, `READY`, `ISSUED`, `SUSPENDED`, `REVOKED`. For additional details about
the status check
the [documentation](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer?tab=readme-ov-file#credential-status).
Using the Issuer Management service the status can be updated

<div class="notice--warning">
  ⚙️ Please, ensure the shell variable <code>CREDENTIAL_ID</code> has been set accordingly (see above).
</div>

```bash
curl -X 'PATCH' http://localhost:8080/management/api/credentials/${CREDENTIAL_ID}/status?credentialStatus=CANCELLED
```

The response then looks like:

```json
{
    "id": "$CREDENTIAL_ID",
    "status": "CANCELLED"
}
```

# Development instructions

Instructions for the development of the swiyu Generic Issuer can be found in
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer?tab=readme-ov-file#development).

## Create Images for ARM based processors

In order to optimize the image for ARM based systems, you first have to check out
the [repository](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer).

Run the following command in the repository to create a local image of the service:

```bash
./mvnw install:install-file -Dfile=lib/primusX-java11-2.4.4.jar -DgroupId=com.securosys.primus -DartifactId=jce -Dversion=2.4.4 -Dpackaging=jar spring-boot:build-image
```

# Testing your instance

We provide a [test application](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-generic-application-test) for running end-to-end
tests and a [test wallet](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-generic-test-wallet) to validate your instance of the
generic components.

# Your Feedback?

We would be pleased if you spend about 3 additional minutes and give us feedback on the swiyu Public Beta Trust
Infrastructure and your onboarding process! With Public Beta, we want to give ecosystem stakeholders the opportunity to
gain initial experience and build their own use cases on the trust infrastructure of the future e-ID.
Your [feedback](https://findmind.ch/c/feedback_publicbeta_infr_en) will help us to further develop and improve the
touchpoints, and we greatly appreciate your support.
