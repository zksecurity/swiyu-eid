# Migration Guide: v3.1.x to v3.2.x
This guide helps you migrate from **v3.1.x** to **v3.2.x** of the Swiyu Issuer Service.
It is based on the **[NEXT]** section in `CHANGELOG.md` and the migration to the hardened
`dhi.io` base image (`#834`).
## Compatibility summary
- **Issuance clients / OID4VCI wallets:** no changes required beyond those already documented
  in the [NEXT] `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
- **Operators / DevOps:** 
    * some defaults have changed in `application.yml`. If you only used the environment variables as in the readme you will not be affected. If you changed `encryption-enforce`, `dpop-enforce` the issuer may stop being compatible with the swiyu wallet. Please refer to the defaults in `application.yml`.
    * the **default** published image is now the hardened
  `dhi.io`-based runtime. The previous UBI-based image is still available as
  `<tag>-unhardened` for a transition period (will be removed in a later release).
        * If you stay on `-unhardened`: **no operational changes** beyond the tag rename.
        * If you adopt the default hardened image: action required, see
    [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes-when-adopting-the-default-hardened-image).
## Choose your path
This release ships **two image variants** so you can decouple the application upgrade from
the runtime hardening:
| Variant | Tag pattern | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|
| **Hardened (default)** | `ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:<tag>` | New deployments; operators who have completed the steps below; anyone who wants the smaller attack surface and `nonroot` runtime now. |
| **Unhardened (transitional)** | `ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:<tag>-unhardened` | Existing deployments that still rely on the shell entrypoint (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`, `MY_SPRING_PROFILES`, `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` + `/lib` JCE mounts). Buys you time to migrate, but **will be removed in a later release** — plan your move. |
### If you stay on `-unhardened`
Only one change is required: update every reference to the published image so it carries
the `-unhardened` suffix.
```diff
- image: ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0
+ image: ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0-unhardened
```
All previously supported environment variables (`MY_SPRING_PROFILES`, `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH`) keep working exactly as in v2.x because
the `-unhardened` image still uses `scripts/entrypoint.sh`. Everything in the
[breaking changes section below](#breaking-changes-when-adopting-the-default-hardened-image)
is **not** required for this path.
### If you adopt the default hardened image
The default image moves to `dhi.io/eclipse-temurin:21-debian13`, runs as the pre-configured
`nonroot` user, and contains **no shell**. The previous `scripts/entrypoint.sh` wrapper —
which translated custom environment variables into JVM system properties at startup — is
gone. The container now invokes `java` directly as its `ENTRYPOINT`.
As a consequence, the project-specific environment variables that only the wrapper
understood are no longer interpreted. You must switch to the JVM-native and Spring-native
equivalents, which the JDK and Spring Boot pick up without a wrapper.
Work through every applicable item in the next section.
## Breaking changes (when adopting the default hardened image)
### 1. Proxy variables: `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` to `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
**Before (v2.x):** the entrypoint wrapper read `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` and
translated them into `-Dhttp.proxyHost`, `-Dhttp.proxyPort=8080`, `-Dhttps.proxyHost`,
`-Dhttps.proxyPort=8080` and `-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts` JVM flags. The port was hard-coded to
`8080`.
**After (v3.0.0):** the wrapper no longer exists. Set the JVM proxy system properties
directly via `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, which the JDK picks up on its own. This also lets you
choose a port other than `8080`.
Example (docker-compose):
```yaml
services:
  swiyu-issuer-service:
    image: ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0
    environment:
      JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: >-
        -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.com
        -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
        -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.com
        -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080
        -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost|127.0.0.1|*.internal.example.com
```
Notes:
- `http.nonProxyHosts` uses `|` as a separator (not `,`) and supports `*` wildcards.
- `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` is a JVM-standard variable; you will see a single line like
  `Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: ...` in the startup logs confirming it was applied.
- If you do **not** use an outbound proxy, leave the variable unset.
### 2. Spring profiles: `MY_SPRING_PROFILES` to `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`
**Before (v2.x):** the entrypoint wrapper read `MY_SPRING_PROFILES` and translated it into
`-Dspring.profiles.active=...`. Spring Boot's own variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` was
ignored unless you set it in addition.
**After (v3.0.0):** drop `MY_SPRING_PROFILES` and use Spring Boot's native variable
`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` directly.
Example (docker-compose):
```yaml
services:
  swiyu-issuer-service:
    image: ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0
    environment:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod,vault
```
Notes:
- Multiple profiles are comma-separated, same as before.
- If you set both variables in a v2.x deployment today, only `MY_SPRING_PROFILES` was
  effective; check that your `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` value is the one you actually want.
### 3. Bootclasspath extras: `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` / `/lib` volume to custom image layer
**Before (v2.x):** the wrapper appended every `.jar` under `${JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH}` (default
`./lib`) to `-Xbootclasspath/a:...` at startup, and the Dockerfile declared `VOLUME ./lib` so
you could mount JCE providers or other vendor JARs into the running container.
**After (v3.0.0):** there is no shell at startup, so the glob expansion that this required
can no longer happen at runtime. If you previously mounted vendor JARs (for example a custom
JCE provider) via `/lib`, you must instead bake them into a derived image:
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0
USER 0
COPY my-jce-provider.jar /app/lib-ext/my-jce-provider.jar
USER nonroot
ENTRYPOINT ["java", \
    "-Duser.timezone=Europe/Zurich", \
    "-Dspring.config.location=classpath:bootstrap.yml,classpath:application.yml,optional:file:/vault/secrets/database-credentials.yml", \
    "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8", \
    "-Xbootclasspath/a:/app/lib-ext/my-jce-provider.jar", \
    "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```
If you never set `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` and never mounted anything into `/lib`, nothing to do.
### 4. HSM (Hardware Security Module): PKCS#11 / vendor JCE provider
The hardened image changes three things that affect HSM-backed signing:
1. **No shell**, so the v2.x entrypoint glob over `${JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH}` is gone — vendor
   JCE JARs are not auto-loaded anymore.
2. **No package manager** and a **minimal native runtime**. System libs many vendor PKCS#11
   `.so` files link against (`libssl.so.3`, `libcrypto.so.3`, `libgssapi_krb5.so.2`,
   `libkrb5.so.3`, `libcurl.so.4`, ...) are **not** present in the image. `libc`, `libdl`,
   `libpthread`, `libstdc++`, `libnsl` and `libnss_*` are present. `libgcc_s.so.1` is
   re-hydrated by the project `Dockerfile.dhi` for the didresolver native library.
3. **Runs as `nonroot`**. Any mounted HSM config file or key directory must be readable by
   that UID — the JVM cannot `chmod` it at startup.
> Two ready-made example Dockerfiles are provided under
> [`examples/hsm/`](../examples/hsm/) — one for the SunPKCS11 path (4a) and one
> for the Securosys Primus JCE provider (4b). Use them as a starting point.
#### 4a. SunPKCS11 (`SIGNING_KEY_MANAGEMENT_METHOD=pkcs11`)
The Sun PKCS#11 bridge (`libj2pkcs11.so`) ships with the JRE in the hardened image, so the
Java side works out of the box. You still need to provide three things:
- The **vendor's native PKCS#11 library** (e.g. `libCryptoki2_64.so`,
  `libsofthsm2.so`, `libprimusp11.so`). Bake it into a derived image.
- Any **transitive `.so` dependencies** the vendor library needs. Check with
  `ldd path/to/vendor.so` on a Debian 13 host; copy the missing libs from a `debian:13-slim`
  builder stage the same way the project `Dockerfile.dhi` rehydrates `libgcc_s.so.1`.
- The **PKCS#11 config file** referenced by `HSM_CONFIG_PATH`. Either bake it into the image,
  or mount it readable by the `nonroot` user (`chmod a+r`, or `chown` to the image's UID).
Example derived image:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: collect vendor + transitive native libs from Debian packages
FROM debian:13-slim AS hsm-libs
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        libssl3 libgssapi-krb5-2 libkrb5-3 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# Vendor PKCS#11 .so brought in from your artifact store
COPY vendor/libCryptoki2_64.so /vendor/
# Stage 2: layer onto the hardened issuer image
FROM ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0
USER 0
COPY --from=hsm-libs /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.3            /app/lib-native/
COPY --from=hsm-libs /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.3         /app/lib-native/
COPY --from=hsm-libs /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgssapi_krb5.so.2    /app/lib-native/
COPY --from=hsm-libs /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libkrb5.so.3           /app/lib-native/
COPY --from=hsm-libs /vendor/libCryptoki2_64.so                       /app/lib-native/
COPY pkcs11.cfg                                                       /app/hsm/pkcs11.cfg
USER nonroot
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH is already /app/lib-native in the base image — these libs are found.
ENTRYPOINT ["java", \
    "-Duser.timezone=Europe/Zurich", \
    "-Dspring.config.location=classpath:bootstrap.yml,classpath:application.yml,optional:file:/vault/secrets/database-credentials.yml", \
    "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8", \
    "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```
Then set `HSM_CONFIG_PATH=/app/hsm/pkcs11.cfg` (and the other `HSM_*` env vars) in your
deployment. The `pkcs11.cfg` file must point its `library = ...` directive at the path
where you placed the vendor `.so` (e.g. `/app/lib-native/libCryptoki2_64.so`).
#### 4b. Vendor JCE provider (e.g. Securosys Primus JCE)
When you used a vendor JCE provider in v2.x, you typically dropped its JAR into the `/lib`
volume and the entrypoint appended it to `-Xbootclasspath/a:...`. With the hardened image you
must bake the JAR in and reference it explicitly:
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0
USER 0
COPY vendor/primusX-java11.jar /app/lib-ext/primusX-java11.jar
# If the provider also ships a native library, add it the same way as 4a above
USER nonroot
ENTRYPOINT ["java", \
    "-Duser.timezone=Europe/Zurich", \
    "-Dspring.config.location=classpath:bootstrap.yml,classpath:application.yml,optional:file:/vault/secrets/database-credentials.yml", \
    "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8", \
    "-Xbootclasspath/a:/app/lib-ext/primusX-java11.jar", \
    "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```
The `HSM_HOST`, `HSM_PORT`, `HSM_USER`, `HSM_PASSWORD`, `HSM_PROXY_USER`,
`HSM_PROXY_PASSWORD`, `HSM_USER_PIN`, `HSM_KEY_ID`, `HSM_KEY_PIN`,
`HSM_STATUS_KEY_ID`, `HSM_STATUS_KEY_PIN` environment variables and
`SIGNING_KEY_MANAGEMENT_METHOD` are unchanged — they are read by the
`swiyu-jws-signature-service` library at runtime, not by any shell wrapper.
#### 4c. Common pitfalls after migration
- **`UnsatisfiedLinkError` / "cannot open shared object file"** at startup — a transitive
  native lib is missing. Reproduce with `ldd vendor.so` on Debian 13 and add the libs to
  `/app/lib-native/` (already on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).
- **`java.io.FileNotFoundException` on `HSM_CONFIG_PATH`** or PKCS#11 init failure with
  `EACCES` — the config file is not readable by the `nonroot` user. Fix permissions on the
  mounted file or bake it into the image.
- **Provider not found** (`NoSuchProviderException`) — the vendor JAR was added but the
  `-Xbootclasspath/a:` flag was not. Confirm the flag appears in the running container's
  `java ...` command.
- **`HSM_*` variables look set but are ignored** — make sure you removed every reference to
  `MY_SPRING_PROFILES`; an unset `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` can leave you on a profile that
  hard-codes `key-management-method: key`.
## Migration checklist
### Staying on `-unhardened` (transitional)
- [ ] Update every image reference in your deployment manifests
  (`docker-compose.yml`, Helm values, Kubernetes `Deployment`, systemd units, ...) so it
  carries the `-unhardened` suffix (e.g. `ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:3.0.0-unhardened`).
- [ ] Plan and schedule the move to the default hardened image — the `-unhardened` variant
  will be removed in a later release.
### Adopting the default hardened image
- [ ] Search your deployment manifests for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` and
  replace them with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` as shown above.
- [ ] Rename `MY_SPRING_PROFILES` to `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`.
- [ ] Remove any `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` setting and `/lib` volume mounts. If you relied on
  this for vendor JARs, build a custom image that bakes them in.
- [ ] Confirm the container starts as user `nonroot` (UID `65532` in the dhi.io image);
  any host-side bind mounts must be readable by that UID.
- [ ] If using an HSM: build a derived image that bakes in the vendor JCE JAR and/or the
  vendor PKCS#11 native library (plus its transitive `.so` deps), make sure
  `HSM_CONFIG_PATH` resolves to a file readable by `nonroot`, and verify the running
  container's `java` command contains `-Xbootclasspath/a:...` if you depend on a vendor JCE
  provider.
- [ ] Smoke-test the deployment: the issuer should reach upstream registries through the
  configured proxy, and the active Spring profiles should appear in the startup banner.
