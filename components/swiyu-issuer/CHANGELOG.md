# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [NEXT]

### Added

- Support for EdDSA signed VCs. When using EdDSA `credential_signing_alg_values_supported` MUST be updated to `Ed25519`
  Likewise `credential_signing_alg_values_supported` is used to indicate what signing algorithm is expected to be used
  by the wallet for proofs.

### Fixed

- Fixed mapping error with deferred credentials and accept unknown fields in `CredentialResponseEncryptionClass` to make
  it more robust with older versions `(#1120, #1130)`.

## Changed use jackson 3 instead of 2

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Added static compliance tests for the Swiss Profile / OID4VCI contract (OpenID Configuration, Credential Issuer
  Metadata, Credential Endpoint, Deferred Credential Endpoint, Nonce, VCT, OCA, JSON Schema endpoints) verifying the
  OpenAPI specification against the OID4VCI spec and Swiss Profile requirements. Tests that require outstanding fixes
  in the OpenAPI contract are disabled and tracked in `(#1127)`.
- Added new config `application.accepted-registry-hosts` to allow restricting the allowed hosts for the trust registry.
  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing, as it may break the trust registry and
  status registry functionality `(#1105)`.
- Verification of Trust Statements with Status Lists using caching according to exp, ttl or maximum cache ttl `(#1105)`.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing claim validation, now also validates the attestation claims `nbf` and `iat` `(#1066)`.
- Re-enabled jwt checks for trust statements, which were temporarily disabled. Do not use trust statements yet, as the
  checks are not yet fully implemented and may cause issues.
- Fixed incorrect caching of invalid trust statement responses `(#996)`.
- The check if encryption is required now uses the designated `applicationProperties.isEncryptionEnforced` value
  `(#1116)`.
- NullPointerException on missing Type during JWTAttestation parsing `(#1129)`.

### Changed

- Updated generic-java-lib to 1.8.3

## [4.0.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Fixed SBOM to contain information about all modules.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Security:** Published container images (hardened and unhardened variants) are now automatically signed with
  [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/) using keyless OIDC signing in the GitHub Actions build workflow. Signatures are
  bound to the immutable image digest and published to the Sigstore transparency log, allowing consumers to verify image
  authenticity via `cosign verify` `(#838)`.

- Integrate `pgpverify-maven-plugin` to cryptographically verify PGP signatures of all third-party dependencies during
  the build. The build fails if an artifact has no signature or an invalid signature. PGP keys are cached in CI/CD to
  avoid redundant downloads `(#836)`.

### Changed

- Status list tokens (`statuslist+jwt`) now include a `ttl` claim and proper `exp`/`iat` timestamps derived from the
  `application.status-list` properties. This allows operators to control how long published status lists are considered
  valid and how long cached status list entries are retained by the wallet. New properties are:
    - `statusListCacheTime` — TTL used by the wallets status list cache.
    - `statusListExpirationTime` — Expiration used when generating status lists.
- Expanded `enc_values_supported` to allow A256GCM encryption in addition to A128GCM `(#877)`.
- Update generic-java-lib to 1.7.0

### Fixed

- Fixed race condition in `CredentialStateMachine`: state machines were shared singletons, causing state corruption
  under concurrent requests. Replaced with `CredentialStateMachineFactory` so each transition operates on an isolated
  instance `(#1021)`.
- Fixed "cannot be parsed exception" with nested arrays in credential subject data update `(#1006)`.
- Fixed incomplete create credential offer request validation, now validates all `metadata_credential_supported_id`.
  Issuance though keeps supporting only a single credential type per offer `(#985)`.
- Fixed Prometheus metrics authentication with Basic Auth `(#1003)`.

### Removed

- Removed the vars `SWIYU_TRUST_REGISTRY_CUSTOMER_KEY` and `SWIYU_TRUST_REGISTRY_CUSTOMER_SECRET` as they are not
  required by the read-only trust registry `(#1075)`.
- Removed support for `claims` in `credential_configurations_supported` details for claims can now be found in
  `credential_metadata.claims` instead as announced earlier. Please update your metadata accordingly. Additional changes
  are:
    - in `client_metadata.display` the `background_image` and `text_color` are now marked as deprecated as they are not
      used and marked as `NOT SUPPORTED` in the Swiss Profile.
    - `client_metadata.display` can no longer be an empty list -> if you do not want to use it, set it to `null` instead
      of an empty list.
    - `client_metadata.display.name` is not nullable anymore in compliance with
      the [OID4VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-credential-issuer-metadata-p)
- Removed `vct#integrity` from issuer metadata as it is no longer used -> use `vct_metadata_uri` and
  `vct_metadata_uri#integrity` instead.

## [3.2.4] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- update generic-java-lib to 1.6.4 for didresolver security updates.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Added null handling to SD-JWT recursive claim processing to avoid NPEs when offer data contains null values.
- **Security:** Fixed Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity in spring-expression by pinning to 7.0.8
- **Security:** Fixed Missing Release of Memory in spring-web by pinning to 7.0.8

## [3.2.2] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Updated didresolver dependency to the latest version.
- **Docker image:** Improved hardened image robustness. See `examples/Dockerfile.dhi.integrator` and
  `examples/README.md` for detailed information on the hardening enhancements `(#XXXX)`.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-06-08

- Add support for signed metadata to the openid-credential-issuer without `{tenantId}`

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Fixed validation of recursively nested array lists in credential claims `(#1000)`.
- Fixed credential renewal not applying `configuration_override` to newly issued VCs `(#1002)`.
- **Security:** DPoP key attestation validation now verifies that the DPoP proof's signing key is listed in the
  attestation's `attested_keys` claim. Previously, a structurally valid attestation for a *different* key was accepted,
  allowing an attacker to obtain access and refresh tokens without possessing the required hardware-backed key
  `(#979)`.
- Fix global config bean being permanently overridden by override mechanism `(#993)`.
- Stop using key attestation for trust requirement evaluation `(#960)`.

### Changed

- **OID4VCI Credential Format**: Newly issued SD-JWT VCs now use `typ: dc+sd-jwt`
  to align with `draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-09`. Issuer metadata
  configurations may declare either `vc+sd-jwt` or `dc+sd-jwt` as `format`
  during the migration period (Expand-Migrate-Contract). `(#178)`
- **Configuration**: Some defaults have changed with the evolving ecosystem.
    - Enabled signed metadata by default. The behavior can be changed by setting ENABLE_SIGNED_METADATA=false (default:
      true).
    - Require Encryption to be used by default.
    - Require DPoP to be used by default.
- **Docker image:** the published image is now hardened. The default
  (unsuffixed) tag `ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:<tag>` builds from
  `dhi.io/eclipse-temurin:21-debian13`, runs as the pre-configured `nonroot` user
  and contains no shell. During a transition period the previous UBI-based image
  remains available under the `-unhardened` suffix
  (`ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:<tag>-unhardened`). Operators who cannot
  immediately adopt the hardened runtime **must pin to the `-unhardened` tag** until
  they have completed the migration steps in
  [`migration-guides/guide-3.1.x-to-3.2.x.md`](migration-guides/guide-3.1.x-to-3.2.x.md);
  the `-unhardened` variant will be removed in a later release. `(#834)`.
- Update OpenAPI specification and local configuration `(#914)`.

### Removed

- fabric8 dependency is removed due to incompatibility with spring boot 4. External configurations are now can still be
  used with the techniques described in https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html For
  example using `spring.config.import`

## [3.1.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- Further opened up DPoP `htu` claim URL rewriting to support partial path-based rewrites via `external_url`, enabling
  setups where the public URI contains a path prefix  `(#971)`. *(Fixed via `generic-java-lib` 1.6.0)*

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Trust Protocol 2.0 Support** `(#881, #882)`:
    - The issuer can now fetch, validate, and cache Identity Trust Statements (idTS) and Protected Issuance
      Authorization Trust Statements (piaTS) from the Trust Registry.
    - **Metadata Injection**: Trust Statements are now dynamically injected into the OID4VCI Issuer Metadata (
      `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer`) based on the requested tenant/DID.
    - **Dynamic Cache Eviction**: `TrustStatementCacheService` implemented with dynamic expiration-based eviction and
      negative caching `(#881)`.
    - Configurable maximum cache TTL for Trust Statements `(#881)`.
- Added support for `iso_18045_enhanced_basic` attestation level for DPoP key attestations `(#937)`.

### Changed

- Migrated to Spring Boot 4.0.6 (Spring Framework 7) `(#537)`:
    - Upgraded Spring Cloud to 2025.1.1 and springdoc-openapi to 3.0.0.
    - Added dedicated starters for extracted autoconfiguration modules: `spring-boot-starter-webclient`,
      `spring-boot-starter-flyway`, and `spring-boot-health`.
    - Retained Jackson 2 (`com.fasterxml.jackson`) via `spring-boot-jackson2` and
      `spring.http.converters.preferred-json-mapper=jackson2` (Boot 4 defaults to Jackson 3).
    - Replaced `HttpStatus` with `HttpStatusCode` in `RenewalException` and `ApiErrorDto` to support non-standard
      HTTP status codes (e.g. 420) no longer present in the `HttpStatus` enum in Spring Framework 7.
    - Upgraded Testcontainers to 2.0 (module artifacts renamed, e.g. `postgresql` → `testcontainers-postgresql`).
    - Removed optional springdoc-openapi dependency from `issuer-application` `(#537)`.
    - [Recursive disclosures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-22?utm_source=chatgpt.com#section-4.2.6)
      are now the default therefore `RECURSIVE_DISCLOSURE_ENABLED` is removed and the non-recursive function removed.

### Fixed

- Fixed negative index handling in `TokenStatusListToken` `(#EIDOMNI-5)`.
- Fixed DPoP `htu` claim URL rewriting to support path-based rewrites via `external_url`, enabling setups where the
  public URI contains a path prefix (e.g. `https://host/public/issuer/`) `(#EIDOMNI-941)`. *(Fixed
  via `generic-java-lib` 1.5.0)*

## 3.0.0

### Added

- Added possibility to add array disclosures and objects without recursion.
    - If `recursiveDisclosureEnabled` is set to false (default) objects are flattened and arrays are added like:

```json
{
    "_sd": [
        "..."
    ],
    "languages": [
        {
            "...": "some digest"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Added possibility to add array disclosures and objects with recursion. If `recursiveDisclosureEnabled` is set to true
  objects and arrays are added as described in the specification:
    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/22/ chapter 4.2.6 and 6.3
- Added `Swiss Government Root CA VI` to image
- Added additional check for logo uri in the issuer metadata to check the logo uri (must
  be a data URI of the mime type image/png or image/jpeg. For example: `data:image/png;base64, ...`
  or `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`)

### Changed

- Breaking Contract change:
    - Removed c_nonce from OAuthTokenDto the nonce can be retrieved from the nonce endpoint.
        - The nonce column from credential_offer table is also removed.
    - Removed Deprecated OID4VCI Draft 13 Endpoints
    - Removed support for did:jwk, as it is not part of the swiss-profiles anymore
- Use OID4VCI 1.0 compliant error codes for credential_endpoint and deferred_credential_endpoint error responses.
- Validation uses now the `credential_metadata.claims` as default for the validation and the `claims` as fallback amd
  don't check surplus.
- Contracted cnf to now only provide the correct shape as defined in RFC 7800
- When not providing any key attestation provider, no key attestations are accepted instead of all.

### Fixed

- Fixed deserialization failure when loading credential offers that contain legacy JSON fields no longer present in the
  current domain model (e.g. `format` in `CredentialRequestClass`).
- Nonces are now validated to originate from this service, preventing client side generated nonces
- Fixed encryption cache invalidation in horizontally scaled deployments: the `IssuerMetadataEncryptionCache` is now
  evicted periodically on every pod via a scheduled task instead of being invalidated only on the pod performing
  the key rotation. This prevents stale pods from publishing deprecated encryption keys in the issuer metadata `(#796)`
- DPoP allows now the correct authorization header, without breaking previously used DPoP header
- Prevent downgrading once using DPoP
- Return OID4VCI compliant error responses, most notably `error_code` is now in lower case
- Fixed false positive webhook callback sent to Business Issuer when a status list write fails during REVOKE or
  SUSPEND `(#786)`:
    - State change events are now only delivered after a successful transaction
      commit (`@TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)`).
    - When the status list update fails and the transaction rolls back, an `ERROR` callback with error
      code `STATUS_LIST_UPDATE_FAILED` is sent instead, so the Business Issuer is correctly informed that the state
      change did not take effect.
- Valid time range of a credential is now inclusive (starting at START DATE 00:00:00 and ending at END DATE 23:59:59)
- Fixed validation of metadata claim descriptor paths. It now correctly supports claims path pointer and validates them
  according to the specs `(#824)`.
- For Credential Response Encryption use the alg in JWK, as defined by the specification.
- Fixed a bug in the `IdentifierRegistryHealthChecker` where an invalid parameter was used for the call.
    - Added new env variable `REGISTRY_HEALTH_CHECKS_ENABLED` to enable status registry health checks
- Fixed nullpointer exception for offer details with deferred offer validity, when using an older offer

## 2.4.0

### Added

- Added `nonce_endpoint`, `deferred_credential_endpoint`, and `batch_credential_issuance` (with min batch size of 10) to
  `sample.compose.yml` `(#737)`.
- New endpoint `/actuator/env` to retrieve configuration details.
- New endpoint `/management/api/credentials/{credentialManagementId}/offers/{offerId}` to retrieve offer-specific
  information `(#577)`.
- New endpoint `/management/api/credentials/{credentialManagementId}/offers/{offerId}/status` to retrieve the status of
  the offer `(#577)`.
- Send callback on every credential offer and credential management status change `(#577)`.
- Added field `event_trigger` to callback request `(#577)`:
    - Set to `CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT` on credential management status change.
    - Set to `CREDENTIAL_OFFER` on credential offer status change.
- Allow setting the used Database Schema with environment variable `POSTGRES_DB_SCHEMA`. Default remains `public`
  `(#604)`.
- Updated Batch Issuance logic `(#642)`:
    - Min batch size must be 10 in metadata to improve privacy.
    - If the wallet sends fewer proofs than requested, the issuer will return a VC for every proof provided and will not
      throw an error.
- Added health checks for stale callbacks, Registry token getting refreshed, and Status List availability `(#268)`.
- Added new validation for `profile_version` to OCA and VCT files. This leads to warnings in the console rather than
  startup failures `(#721)`.
- Support and persist `configuration_override` in `POST /management/api/status-list/{statusListId}` to control key
  material selection (e.g., HSM key) during current and subsequent status list publications `(#690)`.
- Swiss Profile versioning support for future version detection via `profile_version` `(#694)`:
    - Issuer metadata includes `profile_version` in unsigned JSON body and in signed JWT header.
    - SD-JWT VC and Status list tokens include `profile_version` in JWT header.
    - New environment variable `APPLICATION_SWISS_PROFILE_VERSIONING_ENFORCEMENT` (default: false) to optionally enforce
      `profile_version` checks for incoming JWT-based artifacts.
- Add support for VCT version and VCT subtype in issuer metadata `(#749)`.
- Provide `vct_metadata_uri` and its integrity in the issuer metadata when an override is available `(#749)`.

### Fixed

- Return `400 Bad Request` when encryption is required but an unencrypted request is received `(#664)`.
- Allow deferred credential requests to be encrypted and fix related encryption handling `(#602)`.
- Enhanced `Oid4vcException` to include context information in error messages for better readability and debugging
  `(#519)`.
- Fixed weak unlinkability by rounding down timestamps (iat, exp, nbf) within issued credentials `(#548)`.
- Removed `ISSUANCE_PENDING` credential request errors to strictly align with the specification.
- Fixed signed metadata always using the first key, even when keys were rotated by issuers during renewals `(#634)`.
- Deferred credential response when credential data is not ready is now `202 ACCEPTED` `(#665)`.
- Deferred credential `transaction_id` will no longer change during the deferred flow `(#665)`.
- Prohibit renewal of `SUSPENDED` and `REVOKED` VCs and throw a Renewal Exception `(#718)`.
- Reduce the number of calls to the status registry when setting states of renewed and batch-issued VCs `(#746)`.
- Stop sending status update callbacks to Business Issuer when remaining in the same state.
- Return `CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_DENIED` again if the offer was cancelled or expired while being in deferred status.

### Changed

- Optimized Status List updates by bulk loading and reducing repository calls `(#744`, `#746)`.
- Enhanced JWT verification to be included during the initialization of credential requests for better security
  `(#368)`.
- Updated deferred credential handling to better align with the OID4VCI specification `(#665)`.
- Removed the obsolete "version" tag from SD-JWT payloads, Status List tokens, Credential Offer data, and Issuer
  Metadata to align with the current specification `(#694)`.

### Removed

- Breaking Contract change -> Removed c_nonce from OAuthTokenDto the nonce can be retrieved from the nonce endpoint.
    - The nonce column from credential_offer table is also removed.

## 2.3.1

### Fixed

- Allow encryption to be used for deferred credential request
- Allow wallets changing the deferred credential request encryption key using credential_response_encryption
- When using signed metadata with generates dynamic tenant ids, the tenant id is now automatically added to the
  credential issuer identifiers

## 2.3.0

### Added

- Added optional support for DPoP for wallets to begin adopting DPoP for more secure communication.
  As operator of an issuer there is action needed. This feature is added automatically.
  Note: In the future this will be enforced
- Implemented Refresh Flow as Draft implementation according spez. Should not yet used in production `(#292)`
- Integrated Spring State Machine for credential offer and management lifecycles, improving state management and error
  handling (#292).
- Added option to disable/enable refresh_token rotation after usage `(#464)`.
- Added test coverage for signed metadata usage and renewal flow `(#200, #292)`.

### Fixed

- Corrected subject claim in signed metadata and improved metadata endpoint to prefer signed data `(#570)`.
- Fixed size limitations for incoming token calls and responses `(#363)`.
- Fixed edge case with ephemeral signing keys causing server errors `(#426)`.
- Fixed logs displaying management id incorrectly.
- Fixed tests and improved code for signed metadata `(#570, #597)`.
- Fixed response size limitation for token calls `(#363)`.
- Fixed error handling for credential requests missing JWT proof `(#425)`.
- Fixed IT tests for RFC6749 compliance `(#504)`.

## 2.2.0

### Added

- New public service methods to support renewal
    - Renewal uses the existing functionality of issuing a new credential
    - The change introduces a new state machine with different states for offers and the management of offers
    - New env variables:
        - `RENEWAL_FLOW_ENABLED` (default: false) to enable the renewal functionality
        - `BUSINESS_ISSUER_RENEWAL_API_ENDPOINT`: (no default) to set the renewal endpoint where the offer data can be
          fetched from
- Added possibility to update status list manually and disable the automatic synicnhronization.
  New environment variable `DISABLE_STATUS_LIST_SYNCHRONIZATION` (default: false) to disable automatic updates.
  New endpoint `/management/api/status-list/{statusListId}` to trigger manual update of a status list.
- Added support for OAuth 2.0 refresh_token. These are active by default and can be deactivated using the environment
  variable `ALLOW_TOKEN_REFRESH=false`. Only access_tokens belonging to a REVOKED offer can not be refreshed.
- Added new endpoints for signed metadata. The functionality is disabled by default at the moment and can be
  enabled by setting the environment variable `ENABLE_SIGNED_METADATA=true`. This will generate a deeplink with an
  additional tenant id.
    - Added new endpoint `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer-signed-metadata` which provides signed metadata
      according to the OID4VCI spec.
    - Added new endpoint `/management/api/credentials/{credentialId}/signed-metadata` to provide signed
      credential-offer-metadata for a specific credential offer.
- Batch issuance now supports multiple indexes, preventing linkability through status list index.
  The used status list indexes are selected at random from remaining free indexes in status list.
- Updated didresolver dependency from 2.1.3 to 2.3.0

## 2.1.1

### Added

- Added new `vct_metadata_uri`, `vct_metadata_uri#integrity` fields to CredentialOfferMetadataDto which are then added
  to the credential claims
- Added WebhookCallbackDto to openapi config schemas.
- Added new environment variable `URL_REWRITE_MAPPING` to allow rewriting of URLs to support the check of
  key-attestation
- Added `key_attestations` to `CredentialInfoResponseDto.java` to support key attestations in the deferred
  credential flow.
  the credential request.
- Expanded the credential endpoint to accept the new credential-endpoint (with corresponding response)
  defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-credential-endpoint),
  and the deferred credential endpoint which is
  defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-deferred-credential-endpoin).
  These endpoints can be used by setting the custom header `SWIYU-API-Version=2`. These endpoints are not yet pentested.
- Added new error code `CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_DENIED` to indicate that the credential request was denied by the
  issuer and the wallet should not retry.
- Added always available Credential Request Payload encryption, can be enforced to be always active by setting
  APPLICATION_ENCRYPTIONENFORCE=true. Overriding will break compatibility with wallets not supporting encryption.

### Changed

- Changed the `didresolver` version from 2.0.1 to 2.1.3.
- Updated ApiErrorDto and reused it for every error response. This allows for a more consistent error
  response structure.
- Rename of
    - `CreateCredentialRequestDto` to `CredentialEndpointRequestDto` (without dto in openapi schema name)
    - `CredentialRequestDtoV2` to `CredentialEndpointRequestDtoV2` (without dto in openapi schema name)
    - `CredentialResponseDto` to `CredentialEndpointResponseDto` (without dto in openapi schema name)
    - `CredentialResponseDtoV2` to `CredentialEndpointResponseDtoV2` (without dto in openapi schema name)
      to fix inconsistent openapi definition.
- Allow nonce endpoint to be set freely like other endpoints. Not setting the nonce endpoint will prevent you form
  issuing credentials bound to a holder.

### Fixed

- Fixed offers in status `DEFERRED` or `READY` expire when the `offer_expiration_timestamp` has passed.
- `SWIYU_STATUS_REGISTRY_AUTH_ENABLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_FLOW` is now in the application.yaml set to true, as advertised as
  default behaviour in the readme.

### Removed

- Removed possibility of customization of payload encryption.
  It is now always possible for the wallet to choose payload encryption.

## 2.0.0

### Added

- Expanded cnf to contain correct structure while still providing the old one. Example:

```json
{
    "cnf": {
        "kty": "EC",
        "crv": "P-256",
        "x": "...",
        "y": "...",
        "jwk": {
            "kty": "EC",
            "crv": "P-256",
            "x": "...",
            "y": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

- Breaking! Refactored the getCredentialOffer endpoint which now returns all the credential offer information (but not
  the offer data, which is not needed)
    - Deprecated the getCredentialOfferDeeplink endpoint, which is now replaced by the getCredentialOffer endpoint (as
      it delivers the same information)
    - Added new endpoint patch `/management/api/credentials{credentialId}` which updates / creates the credential offer
      for a deferred endpoint.
    - Added a new ClientAgentInfoDto which are used for the deferred credential flow. This is stored in the database
      (db migration is necessary & included)
- Breaking! updated url path to distinguish management (with `/management`) and oid4vci (with `/oid4vci`) urls
- Added new endpoint `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` that provides the same information as the
  `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint but in a OAuth2-centric way.
- The `/.well-known/openid-configuration` still exists and is not deprecated.

- Added new endpoints for
  optional
  OID4VCI [deferred flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html#name-deferred-credential-endpoin)
    - Changed the `/credential` to check if the request is marked as deferred in
      the `credentialMetadata` with `"deferred: true"`, which is set by the issuer-agent-management. The endpoint
      returns a transaction_id
      instead of a credential.
    - Added `/oid4vci/deferred-credential-request` to request deferred credential with the received transaction id
    - Added Documentation in the issuer-agent-management repository.
    - Added new credential request errors that are necessary for the deferred flow: ISSUANCE_PENDING,
      INVALID_TRANSACTION_ID

Example response of the credential endpoint `/credential` ("deferred: true") is:

```json
{
    "transaction_id": "b932ca39-0158-4a31-80e4-8aa15d9d987c",
    "c_nonce": "5585f3ba-e41f-4556-8182-bb148eb8c344"
}
```

Example payload of the request to deferred-credential endpoint`/deferred_credential` is:

```json
{
    "transaction_id": "b932ca39-0158-4a31-80e4-8aa15d9d987c",
    "proof": {
        "proof_type": "jwt",
        "jwt": "..."
    }
}
```

- Enable requesting Key Attestation via Issuer Metadata. This can be used with key_attestation_required. See readme for
  more details.
- Enable receiving and verification of Key Attestations in Credential Request Proofs. Verifying the integrity of the
  attestation and checking if it was issued by one of the issuers trusted in TRUSTED_ATTESTATION_PROVIDERS.
- Fixed incorrect error code when access token is wrong to INVALID_TOKEN instead of INVALID_CREDENTIAL.
- Expanded `/token` functionality. The endpoint accepts now `application/x-www-urlencoded` and no content-type.
  It still accepts the values in the url as request-params (this functionality will be removed in the future) and
  as `x-www-form-urlencoded` body.
- Credential Offer is now validated according to the published metadata. Additional 'surprise' claims are no longer
  supported.
- Optional OAuth security with bearer tokens on `/management` endpoints.
  It can be activated and configured via spring environment variables.

### Fixed

- Fixed offers in status `DEFERRED` or `READY` expire when the `offer_expiration_timestamp` has passed.
- Checks for protected claims are now done in the create-offer-flow (1 step) instead of the issuance flow.
- Business Issuer is directly informed when the payload cannot be processed later.
- Fix status code when jwt filter criteria are not met from a 500 to 401.
- Fixed error code when deferred endpoint is called with invalid transaction id to INVALID_TRANSACTION_ID instead of
  INVALID_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST.
