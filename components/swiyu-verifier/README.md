# SWIYU generic verifier service

This software is a web server implementing the technical standards as specified in
the [swiyu Trust Infrastructure Interoperability Profile](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/specifications/interoperability-profile/).
Together with the other generic components provided, this software forms a collection of APIs allowing issuance and
verification of verifiable credentials without the need of reimplementing the standards.

The generic verifier service provides in its management interface the possibility to initiate a verification process and
in the oid4vp interface the necessary tools to verify a verifiable presentation.

The management interface should be only accessible from inside the organization. Whereas the oid4vp interface needs to
be accessible by the wallet.

# Deployment

> Please make sure that you did the following before starting the deployment:
>
> - Generated the signing keys file with the didtoolbox.jar
> - Generated a DID which is registered on the identifier registry
> - Registered yourself on the swiyuprobeta portal
> - Registered yourself on the api self-service portal

## Container image variants

Starting with v3.0.0 we publish **two image variants** to GHCR so existing operators have a
transition period to adopt the hardened runtime:

| Tag pattern | Base image | Entrypoint | User | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-verifier:<tag>`         | `dhi.io/eclipse-temurin:21-debian13` (hardened, no shell) | `java …` directly | `nonroot` | **Default — recommended** |
| `ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-verifier:<tag>-unhardened`  | `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-ubi9-minimal`                     | `scripts/entrypoint.sh` | UID `1001` | Transitional — will be removed in a later release |

- **New deployments and operators who have completed the migration** should use the default
  (unsuffixed) tag.
- **Operators with pipelines that still depend on the shell-based entrypoint**
  (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`, `MY_SPRING_PROFILES`, `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` /
  `/lib` JCE-provider mounts) must pin to the `-unhardened` suffix while they apply the
  changes in [`migration-guides/v2.x-to-v3.0.0.md`](migration-guides/v2.x-to-v3.0.0.md).
- The two `Dockerfile`s in this repository (`Dockerfile.dhi` for the default, `Dockerfile`
  for the `-unhardened` variant) are both built and Snyk-scanned on every PR.

### Verifying image signatures

All published images are signed with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/) using keyless
(OIDC) signing directly in the GitHub Actions build workflow. The signature is bound to the
image digest and recorded in the public Sigstore transparency log. You can verify the
authenticity of an image before deploying it:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-verfier/.github/workflows/docker-builder.yml@.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  ghcr.io/swiyu-admin-ch/swiyu-issuer:<tag>
```

## 1. Set the environment variables

A sample compose file for an entire setup of both components and a database can be found
in [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml) file.
**Replace all placeholder <VARIABLE_NAME>**. In addition to that you need to adapt
the [verifier metadata](sample.compose.yml#L35) to your use case.
Those information will be provided to the holder on a dedicated endpoint serving as metadata information of your
verifier.

Please be aware that the **oid4vp** endpoints need to be publicly accessible and set in the environment variable
`EXTERNAL_URL`.

## 2. Creating a verification

> For a detailed understanding of the verification process and the data structure of verification please consult the
> [DIF presentation exchange specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#presentation-definition).
> For more information on the general verification flow consult
> the [OpenID4VP specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-20.html)

Once the components are deployed you can create your first verification. For this you first need to define a
presentation
definition. Based on that definition you can then create a verification request for a holder as shown in the example
below.
In this case we're asking for a credential called "my-custom-vc" which should at least have the attributes
firstName and lastName. The following request can be performed by using the swagger endpoint on https://<EXTERNAL_URL of
verifier-agent-management>**/swagger-ui/index.html**

To see more details and examples of the verification process please consult the [documentation](docs/verification_process.md).

## Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL)

### Overview
The verifier service now supports the Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL) as specified in the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP) Standard 1.0. This replaces the previous DIF Presentation Exchange (PE) specification that was integrated into the "claims" request parameter.


### Verification Flow with DCQL
1. **Creation**: Business Verifier creates verification request with DCQL query
2. **Storage**: Verifier Service stores request in database
3. **Holder Retrieval**: Holder uses Verification URI to get request object containing DCQL query
4. **Presentation**: Holder's wallet processes DCQL query to identify suitable credentials
5. **Verification**: Service validates credentials against DCQL query criteria
6. **Status Update**: Business Verifier receives status and requested data via polling or webhooks

### VP Token Response Encryption
- Required after transition period
- Uses client_metadata for encryption information


## Deployment Considerations
Please note that by default configuration the verifier service is set up in a way to easily gain experience with the verification process,
not as a productive deployment. With the configuration options found below, it can be configured and set up for productive use.

We recommend to not expose the service directly to the web.
The focus of the application lies in the functionality of the verification.
Using API Gateway or Web Application Firewall can decrease the attack surface significantly.

To prevent misuse, the management endpoints should be protected either by network infrastructure (for example mTLS) or using OAuth.

# Development

> Please be aware that this section **focus on the development of the verifier service**. For the deployment of
> the component please consult [deployment section](#Deployment).

## Note on container runtimes

For the purpose of integration testing, `@Testcontainers` annotation is used broadly in this repo.
Needless to say, to run [Testcontainers](https://java.testcontainers.org)-based tests, you would need a Docker-API compatible container runtime.
As Docker has made a few changes to its licensing in the past,
[alternative container runtimes](https://java.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/) started gaining on popularity.

In general, switching the container runtime from Docker to any other (such as Podman/[Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io))
for [Testcontainers in Java](https://java.testcontainers.org) usually requires awareness of socket configuration, cleanup mechanisms,
permissions, and underlying differences. So, [customizing Docker host detection](https://java.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#customizing-docker-host-detection)
would be more or less all it takes to make it work.

Luckily, one of the quite popular Docker alternatives featuring pretty seamless integration is [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io).
Although the [official manual](https://podman-desktop.io/tutorial/testcontainers-with-podman) suggests otherwise,
from our experience on macOS, it would be sufficient to enable the [Docker Compatibility](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/managing-docker-compatibility)
feature and the tests would all run through. Furthermore, running `mvn clean install` for the first time would even implicitly create
a minimalistic [`$HOME/.testcontainers.properties`](https://java.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/), if not found in your home directory.

## Single service development

Run the following commands to start the service. This will also spin up a local postgres database from
the docker compose.yml:

```shell
./mvnw -f verifier-application  spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local # start spring boot java application
```

After the start api definitions can be found [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

### Updating Openapi Spec

The `openapi.yaml` can be updated by using the generate-doc profile.

```
mvn verify -P generate-doc
```

## Configuration

### Generate Keys

Currently only EC 256 keys are used.
Generate private key with:
`openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem`
Remember to keep private keys private and safe. It should never be transmitted, etc.

On the base registry the public key is published. To generate the public key form the private key we can use
`openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem`

### HSM - Hardware Security Module

For operations with an HSM, the keys need not be mounted directly into the environment running this application.
Instead, a connection is created to the HSM via JCA. This can be with
the [Sun PKCS11 provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/security/pkcs11-reference-guide1.html) or a vendor
specific option.
Note that for creating the keys it is expected that the public key is provided as self-signed certificate.

For vendor specific options it is necessary to provide the library in the Java classpath. How
you do this depends on the image variant you deploy (see
[Container image variants](#container-image-variants)):

- **Default hardened image** (`dhi.io`-based, distroless-style, no shell) — the entrypoint
  invokes `java` directly, so a classpath directory cannot be expanded at startup. Vendor
  JARs must be baked into a derived image and referenced explicitly via `-Xbootclasspath/a:`,
  and vendor PKCS#11 native libraries (`.so`) need their transitive C-runtime dependencies
  staged in because the hardened base image strips them. Ready-made example Dockerfiles for
  both common setups are in [`examples/hsm/`](examples/hsm/):
    - [`examples/hsm/Dockerfile.sunpkcs11`](examples/hsm/Dockerfile.sunpkcs11) — JDK-bundled
      SunPKCS11 bridge against a vendor module (SoftHSM2, Thales Luna, nCipher, …).
    - [`examples/hsm/Dockerfile.securosys`](examples/hsm/Dockerfile.securosys) — Securosys
      Primus JCE provider via the vendor JAR.

  The pattern (multi-stage build to stage native libs into `/app/lib-native/`, vendor JAR
  baked into `/app/lib-ext/`, explicit `-Xbootclasspath/a:` in `ENTRYPOINT`) and the common
  pitfalls are documented in
  [`migration-guides/v2.x-to-v3.0.0.md` §4](migration-guides/v2.x-to-v3.0.0.md).

- **Unhardened `-unhardened` image** (transitional) — the shell entrypoint still expands
  `${JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH}` (default `./lib`) into `-Xbootclasspath/a:…`, so mounting a
  volume that contains the vendor JARs at `/app/lib` keeps working as before.

### Webhook Callbacks

For verifiers, it can be useful to receive a webhook callback from this service
instead of performing active polling to check if a verification has been done.
It is possible to configure a Webhook Callback endpoint, optionally secured by API Key. Please note that delivery of
callback events will be retried until successful, to guarantee an at-least-once delivery.
Failed deliveries will create error logs and be retried in the next interval.

Callbacks will be sent on change of verification state. This means the verification can be fetched by the business
verifier.

Callback Object Structure

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| verification_id | ID of the element the callback is about. For now the management id of the verification |
| timestamp       | timestamp the event occurred. Can differ from the time it is sent.                     |

### Security

The management endpoints for both the issuer/verifier (generic component) might seem like they're unprotected and that there is a lack of controls securing them. This is because they are meant to be used exclusively by the business issuer/verifier (business component) that are built on top of them by each participant in the ecosystem. The generic component should be considered closer to a library than to stand-alone services. As such these endpoints are meant to be deployed in a way where they can only be accessed by the business component of the software. The threat model therefore excludes attackers being able to send crafted payloads to these management endpoints. If attackers can send anything to these endpoints, they must have completely taken over the business component and can already do everything.

Management Endpoints can be secured as OAuth2 Resource Server using Spring Security, if required. The generic component leaves user management to the business component.

For more details see the official [spring security documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/index.html).

For easy playground setup or when using the component in an isolated zone security starts deactivated. It is activated when the appropriate environment variables are set.

### Adding certificates to the image via the `certs` directory

To add additional CA or TLS certificates to the application image, place PEM encoded files into the project `certs`
directory (path: `./certs`) and rebuild the image. Certificates must end with `crt`. Do not store private keys
in `certs`.

Steps:

1. Copy one or more `.crt` files to `./certs` (e.g. `my-ca.crt`).
2. Rebuild the Docker image so the files are included.
3. Certificates are imported into the truststore during image build.

## Usage

### Perform a verification

To perform a verification, it is required to first create the request. This is done with
the `POST /management/verifications`
endpoint.
What data is requested can be selected by adding in additional fields only containing "path".
Filters are currently only supported for `$.vct` - the Verifiable Credential Type.
In the following example we request to have the dateOfBirth revealed to us from a Credential with the type "test-sdjwt".

#### Optional: vqPS Registration (Trust Protocol 2.0)

If `SWIYU_TMS_AUTHORING_URL` is configured, you can optionally provide a `verification_purpose` object in the request body. The verifier will then automatically register (or reuse) a Verification Query Public Statement (vqPS) with the TMS and inject it into the signed Authorization Request sent to the wallet. This allows wallets to display a verified, human-readable purpose for the verification.

```json
{
  "dcql_query": { "...": "..." },
  "verification_purpose": {
    "scope": "com.example.age_verification",
    "purpose_name": {
      "default": "Age Verification",
      "en": "Age Verification",
      "de-CH": "Altersverifikation"
    },
    "purpose_description": {
      "default": "We verify that you are of legal age.",
      "en": "We verify that you are of legal age.",
      "de-CH": "Wir prüfen, ob Sie volljährig sind."
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The verifier accepts both `dc+sd-jwt` (current spec, SD-JWT VC Draft 06+) and `vc+sd-jwt` (legacy SD-JWT VC drafts ≤ 05) on the credential's `typ` header.

The response of this post call contains the URI which has to be provided to the holder.

## Docker Image Tagging Strategy

Docker images for this project follow a formalized environment-based tagging approach:

| Tag     | Meaning                  | Description                                                                                       |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dev     | Development Build        | Latest commit from the development branch. Automatically generated on every push to `main`.       |
| staging | Integration Test Build   | Set at the end of a sprint or after completion of a feature for integration testing.              |
| rc      | Release Candidate        | Frozen state prior to release and penetration testing.                                            |
| stable  | Verified Production      | Released after successful QA and penetration testing.                                             |

These tags are assigned automatically or manually as part of the CI/CD workflow. This ensures that environments can reliably reference images by their lifecycle stage (e.g., `swiyu-issuer-service:staging`) without requiring manual version management.

### Promotion Workflow

The image promotion process follows these steps:

```text
[Commit → dev]
    ↓    build & push :dev
[Feature completed / Sprint end]
    ↓    promote → :staging
[Release candidate created]
    ↓    promote → :rc
[QA & penetration test passed]
    ↓    promote → :stable
```

## Release Process and Versioning

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
This project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to make it easy to understand the impact of a software release just by looking at the version number. Our version numbers follow the format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-rc][+BUILD]
```

### Version Components

#### MAJOR version (X.y.z)
- Incremented when we Contract the system by removing, changing, or breaking existing features
- Example: Removing a deprecated endpoint, changing response formats in a non-compatible way

#### MINOR version (x.Y.z)
- Incremented when we Extend the system with new, backward-compatible functionality
- Example: Adding a new endpoint, introducing an optional field, or extending valid inputs

#### PATCH version (x.y.Z)
- Incremented when we Maintain the system with backward-compatible security fixes on Release Branch
- Example: Security bug fixes or important performance optimizations needed on the last Release

### Release Candidates
Release Candidates (RCs) are tagged as prereleases to indicate a build that is a candidate for the next official release:

- Format: x.y.z-rc.N (e.g., 1.4.0-rc.1, 1.4.0-rc.2)
- Used for testing, validation, and final quality assurance
- Once validated, the RC suffix is dropped for the official release
- Example: 1.4.0-rc.1, 1.4.0-rc.2 → 1.4.0 (final release)

### Release Workflow
Our release process follows these principles:

Version Contract: If you upgrade within the same MAJOR version, your existing integrations will continue to work (following the Expand and Migrate Pattern)

GitHub Pre-release Tagging:
- All versions with -rc.N suffix (e.g., 2.1.0-rc.1) are published as GitHub Prereleases
- Prereleases are meant for testing, staging, and final validation
- After validation, we remove the -rc suffix and publish the official release (e.g., 2.1.0)
- Official releases are not marked as pre-releases on GitHub

## Missing Features and Known Issues

The swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure was deliberately released at an early stage to enable future ecosystem participants. The [feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/projects/1/views/7) shows the current discrepancies between Public Beta and the targeted productive Trust Infrastructure. There may still be minor bugs or security vulnerabilities in the test system. These are marked as [‘KnownIssues’](../../issues) in each repository.
